        "# FILE EXCEPTION HANDLING\n",
        "\n",
        "1.What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        " - Interpreted languages: Code is executed line by line at runtime (e.g., Python). Slower but easy to debug.\n",
        " - Compiled languages: Code is translated into machine language before execution (e.g., C, C++). Faster but needs recompilation after every change.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " - Exception handling is a process that allows a program to handle errors without crashing. It provides a way to catch errors and take proper action, making programs more reliable.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        " - The finally block ensures that specific code always runs, whether an exception occurs or not. It is mainly used for cleanup operations such as closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.What is logging in Python?\n",
        " - Logging is the process of recording important events, warnings, or errors in a program’s execution. It helps in debugging, monitoring, and keeping a history of program activities.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.What is the significance of the del method in Python?\n",
        " - The __del__ method is a destructor in Python. It is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed. It is used for cleanup tasks like releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        " - import: Brings the entire module, functions are accessed using the module name.\n",
        " - from ... import: Brings specific functions or classes directly, used without prefixing the module name.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        " - Multiple exceptions are handled by writing more than one except block. Each block handles a different type of error, allowing the program to react appropriately.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        " - The with statement is used to handle files safely. It automatically opens and closes files, even if an error occurs, ensuring no resource leakage.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        " - Multithreading: Runs multiple threads within a single process, sharing memory. Suitable for I/O-bound tasks.\n",
        " - Multiprocessing: Runs multiple processes, each with separate memory. Suitable for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        " - Provides detailed program information.\n",
        " - Helps in debugging and error tracking.\n",
        " - Allows real-time monitoring.\n",
        " - Maintains permanent records of program events.\n",
        "\n",
        "11.What is memory management in Python?\n",
        " - Memory management is the process of allocating and releasing memory during program execution. Python uses automatic garbage collection to manage memory efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        " - Put risky code in a try block.\n",
        " - Catch exceptions using except blocks.\n",
        " - Use else block if no exception occurs.\n",
        " - Use finally block for cleanup actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        " - Memory management ensures efficient use of system resources. It prevents memory leaks, improves performance, and helps programs run smoothly.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        " - try: Contains code that may cause an error.\n",
        " - except: Defines how the program should handle the error if it occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "15.How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        " - Python’s garbage collector automatically removes unused objects from memory. It uses reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector to free memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "16.What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        " - The else block runs only if no exception occurs in the try block. It is useful for code that should execute only when everything goes correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "17.What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        " - DEBUG – Detailed information for developers.\n",
        " - INFO – General program execution information.\n",
        " - WARNING – Something unexpected happened, but not critical.\n",
        " - ERROR – A serious issue that may affect program execution.\n",
        " - CRITICAL – Very serious errors, program may stop.\n",
        "\n",
        "18.What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        " - os.fork(): Creates a child process at the OS level (mainly in Unix/Linux).\n",
        " - multiprocessing: A Python module that provides a high-level way to create and manage processes, works across platforms.\n",
        "\n",
        "19.What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        " - Closing a file releases system resources and ensures all data is saved correctly. If not closed, it may cause data loss or memory leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "20.What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        " - file.read(): Reads the entire file (or specified number of characters).\n",
        " - file.readline(): Reads one line from the file at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "21.What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        " - The logging module is used to track and record events during program execution. It helps in debugging, monitoring, and error reporting.\n",
        "\n",
        "22.What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        " - The os module allows interaction with the operating system. In file handling, it is used for creating, deleting, renaming, and checking files or directories.\n",
        "\n",
        "23.What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        " - Memory leaks due to circular references.\n",
        " - High memory usage with large datasets.\n",
        " - Dependence on garbage collection, which may not always be predictable.\n",
        " - Slower performance compared to low-level languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "24.How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        " - An exception can be raised manually using the raise keyword. This is useful when programmers want to enforce rules or signal errors intentionally.\n",
        "\n",
        "25.Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        " - Multithreading is important in applications where multiple tasks need to run at the same time, such as downloading files, handling user input, or network operations. It improves efficiency and responsiveness."
